- All Posts: 
  - The “All Posts” link in the navigation bar should take the user to a page where they can see all posts from all users, with the most recent posts first.
  - Each post should include the username of the poster, the post content itself, the date and time at which the post was made, and the number of “likes” the post has

Profile Page: 
  - Clicking on a username should load that user’s profile page. 
  - This page should:
    - Display the number of followers the user has, as well as the number of people that the user follows.
    - Display all of the posts for that user, in reverse chronological order.
    - For any other user who is signed in, 
        - this page should also display a “Follow” or “Unfollow” button that will let the current user toggle whether or not they are following this user’s posts. 
          - Note that this only applies to any “other” user: a user should not be able to follow themselves.
